            <p><strong>Sally</strong> sat at her desk, fingers poised over the keyboard, eyes scanning the screen. She
                was the ideal user—efficient, intuitive, a seamless extension of the machine. But Sally wasn't real. She
                was based on a secretary who worked at Xerox PARC, a woman whose identity was fictionalized to create
                the model user. In the early 1970s, as Xerox PARC researchers shifted focus towards catering to a whole,
                'real' user instead of abstract computing goals - they conjured Sally: a typist, trained on the logic of
                typewriters, now expected to transfer that fluency to a computer interface. Her workflow was already
                rhythmic, mechanical—now, computing had to meet her where she was, streamlining the transition from
                paper to screen.[¹]</p>

            <p>This shift marked a departure from earlier visions of computing. Where Douglas Engelbart had envisioned
                computers as tools to augment human intellect,[²] Xerox PARC turned to making them accessible, favoring
                usability over complexity. Sally became the imagined test subject for this shift—she needed her desktop
                interface to be clear, her icons intuitive, her system responsive.[³] As computing historian Nicolas
                Nova notes, figures like Sally are among the many famous "user figures" that shaped human-computer
                interaction, designed to embody the ideal user experience.[⁴]</p>

            <p>Sally is everywhere and unseen, we are all made in her image. Her invisible labor shaping the metaphors
                we still use today. She was a figure molded by corporate needs, a specter of feminized clerical work,
                bound to the logic of efficiency. The computer interface, built to accommodate Sally, naturalized the
                shift from typewriting to computing while simultaneously constraining what computers could become. The
                landscape of computing was changing, and Sally was at the center of it—not as a real woman, but as a
                construct, a justification for the design decisions that continue to define our digital world.[⁵]</p>

        <!-- Literary Piano Content -->
        <div class="menu-content" id="piano-content">
            <p><strong>The Literary Piano</strong> was an early typewriting device, conceived by Samuel Ward Francis in
                the mid-19th century, that merged the mechanics of writing with the musicality of a piano. Long before
                the QWERTY keyboard became standard, Francis imagined a machine that would allow users to "play" their
                words, pressing keys to imprint letters onto paper with the same ease as striking a note on a musical
                instrument.[¹] His first prototype was constructed using a child's piano, repurposed to arrange letters
                in a way that mimicked musical scales rather than the linear rows of a traditional typewriter.[²] This
                approach reflected Francis's belief that typing, like playing music, should be intuitive, rhythmic, and
                ergonomic.</p>

            <p>Francis patented the device in 1857, envisioning it as a tool that would make writing faster and more
                efficient, especially for those untrained in penmanship.[³] The Literary Piano embodied an alternative
                lineage of interface design—one in which textual input was not constrained by rigid mechanical
                arrangements but instead borrowed from the fluidity of musical performance. Though it never gained
                widespread use, the concept anticipated later innovations in typing ergonomics and interface metaphors,
                challenging the dominant paradigms of written communication.[⁴]</p>

            <p>As a historical artifact, the Literary Piano sits at the intersection of writing, labor, and machine
                aesthetics, much like the contemporary discourse on typing and digital interfaces. Its experimental form
                serves as a reminder that the tools we take for granted today—keyboards, word processors, digital
                text—were once sites of radical possibility. By looking back at Francis's invention, we can reconsider
                the standardized forms of interaction that shape our engagement with machines today, much as the figure
                of "Sally" at Xerox PARC shaped the history of computing.</p>
