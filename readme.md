Collecting workspace information# Type Synthesizer

This project is a simple synthesizer built using the p5.js library and the p5.sound library. It allows users to play musical notes by typing specific keys on their keyboard. The typed keys are also displayed on the screen.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Project:**
   - Open this project in your browser using a web server (e.g., VSCode Live Server or another local server).

2. **Start the Audio Context:**
   - Click or press a key to allow the browser to start the audio context (some browsers need a user interaction before playing sound).

3. **Play Notes:**
   - Type keys that correspond to notes to hear the synth. The typed keys also get printed on the screen.

4. **Adjust Settings:**
   - Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to change the attack time (ADSR) or the delay time.

5. **Resize the Window:**
   - Resize your browser window â€” the canvas will automatically resize.
